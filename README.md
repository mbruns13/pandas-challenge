### Week 4 Homework

*Using Pandas and Jupyter Notebook, create a report that includes the following data. Your report must include a written description of at least two observable trends based on the data.*

1. Students at charter schools have higher average scores in math and in reading, and are passing one or both of those classes in higher percentages than the students in disctrict schools

2. Students in larger schools (with 2,000-5,000 students) have lower average math and reading scores, and the percentages of students passing math/reading/both are much lower for students in the larger schools.

3. Spending ranges per student does not seem to have a positive effect on the success of students in math or reading. The students in schools with the highest spending range per student (\\$645-\\$680) have the lowest percentage of students passing both math and reading.


4. There does not seem to be any major difference between grades within each school when it comes to their average math and reading scores.
